**YAKS2-TITUO** is an **"Intelligent" kickstart switcher** for the Amiga A500-A600-A2000 and A1200-A4000, with unique features:

- A500/A600/A2000 version
  - Can switch among four or eight different kickstarts
  - Kickstarts can be flashed at any time by mean of YAKS2 adapter and any common chip flasher, capable of managing 29F080 chips
  - Kickstart selection by mean of CTRL-A-A without the need of any additional wiring inside Amiga
  - Keep track of the selected kickstart upon poweroff
  - Optional audible kickstart selection confirmation 

- A1200/A4000 version
  - Can switch among two or four different kickstarts
  - Kickstarts must be flashed before board assembling (not re-flashable)
  - Kickstart selection by mean of CTRL-A-A without the need of any additional wiring inside Amiga
  - Keep track of the selected kickstart upon poweroff
  - Optional audible kickstart selection confirmation 

## YAKS2-TITUO FLAVORS

#### **BILL OF MATERIALS**

Components noted as "Optional" fulfil the general purpose STM32F1x reference design; generally speaking they can be safely omitted from the assembly of HID2AMI. Consider soldering any of them in case you experience some instability of any kind (never experienced so far).

LED1 is "run mode" indicator; it blinks at variable rates to indicate HID2AMI running status (suggesetd colors: green, yellow, white)
- When in BOOTLOADER mode, a fast blink means bootloader running and waiting for the "App" to be flashed/upgraded
- When in APP mode, a "regular" blinking means the App is running and waiting for input; a slower blinking (upon connecting a peripheral), means the peripheral correctly identified and mapped 

LED2 is the "power on" indicator; if lit then your board gets correct +5V and +3.3V power supply 

For both LED1 and LED2, the suggested value for their respective limiting current resistors is 10k, but you can safely experiment any value in range 1k-47k depending on the led components characteristics and light efficiency (and your personal taste)

### **HID2AMI BOOTLOADER** 
is free to download, copy and redistribuite.

### **HID2AMI APP** 
is distribuited by request from the author; each instance is strictly tied 1:1 to a particular HID2AMI board. You are not allowed to copy and distribuite HID2AMI APP in any medium or format. 

## **DISTRIBUTION AND PRICING POLICY**
I've spent a great effort in designing and developing this app, so I would be grateful if you'd be happy to contibute to its future development. I decided to release all project's details, schematics and gerbers for free to everyone, but retaining myself close control over the firmware app. Being this one a no-profit hobbyist project, I can't guarantee any volume production of boards, so I will following the following distributio policies, for who may be interested in having one:

- Software only
  - You build the board yourself, by mean of the public gerbers or by a compatible custom layout you derive from schematics
  - You get the APP from me by sending me a request together with your personal 4-digits code (see instructiuons above how to get it)
  - Availability to serve request and cost of the app shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting. Find HID2AMI on [Amigapage](http://www.amigapage.it), [EAB](https://eab.abime.net), [A1K](https://www.a1k.org). 

- DYI KIT
  - You build the board yourself by getting from me the pcb and all needed components
  - You get the APP from me by sending me a request together with your personal 4-digits code 
  - Availability and costs of DIY kits shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting. Find HID2AMI on [Amigapage](http://www.amigapage.it), [EAB](https://eab.abime.net), [A1K](https://www.a1k.org).

- COMPLETE BOARD
  - You get the fully working board from me by sending me a request 
  - (Rare) Availability and costs of complete boards shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting
